## How do I use a node with username & password?
```username:password@node.address:portnumber```

## The app always crashes as soon as I open a wallet!
Users of Zenfone MAX & Zenfone 2 Laser (possibly others) **MUST** use the armeabi-v7a APK as the arm64-v8a build uses hardware AES
functionality these models don't have. If this does not help, please report the problem.

## I cannot select and copy the mnemonic seed
Copying anything to the clipboard on Android exposes it to any other App running. So this
is a security measure to keep your seed safe(r). 

## My storage is getting full
Newly generated wallets are stored in `.new` in the main wallet folder.
They are never erased (for now). You can delete this whole folder from time to time.

Also, the backup folder named "`backups`" (formerly `.backups`) is never automatically cleaned up.
You may want to do housekeeping manually with a file browser.

All wallet files (`stagenet` and `mainnet`) are stored in the main `loki-wallet` folder.
So be careful erasing stuff. One of the future releases will split the wallets and move `stagenet`
 wallets out of there.

## Do you have any screenshots of what it looks like and how it works?
No, but it looks fantastic. Just check it out.

## Can I use existing wallet files?

If you want to use existing wallet files, you need to copy the wallet files from you current Loki client. These are:
```
WalletName
WalletName.address.txt
WalletName.keys
```

### From where?

This depends on your installation - you could search for them in your home directory or check the settings of your current client. Places to try are:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Loki\wallets`
- Mac/Linux: `~/Loki/wallets`

...or just search for `WalletName.keys`.

### What if don't have these files?

Keep calm and make a new wallet.

## Why does it make a 'loki' folder?
This is a new feature of Loki core to share certain key images with other Loki forks.

## CrAzYpass is awesome - but I don't want it!
Creating a file named `.nocrazypass` in the wallets folder will disable generation of crazypass for NEW passwords (new wallet or change password).
The content of the file is not read and is irrelevant.
Wallets with CrAzYpass will continue working normally. The currently set real wallet password can be checked in the "Show Secrets".

**NB: This feature is for test purposed only - all your XMR will be stolen if you use it!**
